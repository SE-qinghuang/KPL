Questions:
1: What specific operations need to be performed on the String?
2: What type of output do you need after splitting the String based on multiple delimiters?
3: What specific delimiters need to be used in the string split operation?
please select question:
What specific operations need to be performed on the String?

Answer:
Splitting the String based on multiple delimiters.

Revised Query: The query is asking for a way to split a String based on multiple delimiters.

Recommend APIs:
1. java.lang.String.split(String regex)
2. java.util.StringTokenizer.nextToken()
3. java.util.StringJoiner.add()
4. java.util.regex.Pattern.split(CharSequence input)
5. java.util.StringJoiner.toString()
6. java.lang.String.replaceAll(String regex)


Questions:
1: Is the splitter for each delimiter the same or unique?
2: What type of delimiters is the String being split on?
3: How many delimiters should be used to split the String?
please select question:
Is the splitter for each delimiter the same or unique?

Answer:
Unique.

Revised Query: The query is to perform splitting of a String based on multiple unique delimiters.

Questions:
1: What is the expected output after splitting the String with multiple delimiters?
2: What type of delimiters are you using to split the String?
3: What type of delimiters are you wanting to use for splitting the String?
please select question:
What is the expected output after splitting the String with multiple delimiters?

Answer:
The expected output after splitting the String with multiple delimiters is an array of substrings.

Revised Query: The query is to perform splitting of a String based on multiple unique delimiters, resulting in an array of substrings as the output.

Questions:
1: What type of array do you expect as the output?
2: What is the data-type of the delimiter(s) used to split the String?
3: What data type is expected for the delimiters of the String?
please select question:
What type of array do you expect as the output?

Answer:
String array.

Revised Query: The query is to perform splitting of a String based on multiple delimiters, with each delimiter having a unique splitter, resulting in an output of a String array.

5. java.util.StringTokenizer.hasMoreTokens() -- (new)


Questions:
1: Does the Java API need to support splitting the String by all of the delimiters simultaneously, or separately for each delimiter?
2: What is the desired size of the String array after splitting the String based on multiple delimiters?
3: Would the size of the returned array of substrings depend on the number of delimiters used to split the string?

Answer:
The Java API needs to support splitting the String by all of the delimiters simultaneously.

Revised Query: The query is to find a Java API that can split a String based on multiple delimiters simultaneously, with the expected output being an array of substrings.

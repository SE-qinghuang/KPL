Query: Calculate whether an IP address is in a specified range in Java.


Questions:
1: What is the format of the IP address and specified range?
2: What is the size of the IP address range?
3: What is the IP address range that you are trying to compare the IP address against?
please select question:
What is the format of the IP address and specified range?

Answer:
The format of the IP address and specified range is IPv4.

Revised Query: The query is expanded to: "Calculate whether an IPv4 IP address is in a specified IPv4 range in Java."

Questions:
1: What type of data do the IP address and specified range take in the calculation?
2: What is the data type of the IP address and the specified range in Java?
3: What data type will be used to represent the IP address and specified range?
please select question:
What type of data do the IP address and specified range take in the calculation?

Answer:
The IP address and specified range should take a String data type.

Revised Query: Calculate whether an IPv4 IP address in String data type is in a specified range in String data type using Java.

Questions:
1: What is the expected output after calculation for if an IP address is in a specified range (e.g. a boolean value)?
2: Are there any pre-existing Java libraries or packages that provide methods for validating whether an IP address is in a specified range in IPv4 format?
3: What is the format of the IP address and specified range?
please select question:
What is the expected output after calculation for if an IP address is in a specified range (e.g. a boolean value)?

Answer:
The expected output after calculation is a boolean value indicating whether an IP address is in a specified range.

Revised Query: Calculate whether an IPv4 IP address and specified range, both taking a String data type, are in the same range, and return a boolean value.

Questions:
1: What library in Java should be used to calculate whether an IP address is in a specified range given its IPv4 format as a String?
2: Does the String data type of the IP address and specified range include each part of the IP address and the boundary of the range, or two arbitrary values for the range?
3: What is the exact format of the IP address and specified range? Which data type should the expected output have?
please select question:
What library in Java should be used to calculate whether an IP address is in a specified range given its IPv4 format as a String?

Answer:
InetAddress class in the java.net package should be used to calculate whether an IP address is in a specified range given its IPv4 format as a String.

Revised Query: Calculate whether an IP address in IPv4 format as a String is in a specified range using the InetAddress class in the java.net package, and return a boolean value indicating the result.

Questions:
1: What is the format of the String data type for the given IP address and the specified range?
2: Do you want to calculate the status of an IPv4 address whether it's in a specified range within the same Java class or by calling an external library?
3: Are there any constraints on the format of the IP address and specified range, apart from needing to be in IPv4 format as a String?
please select question:
What is the format of the String data type for the given IP address and the specified range?

Answer:
The format of the String data type for the given IP address and the specified range is IPv4.

Revised Query: The InetAddress class in the java.net package should be used to calculate whether an IP address in IPv4 format as a String is in a specified range in IPv4 format as a String.

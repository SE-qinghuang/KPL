Query: Deep copy of an object array.


Questions:
1: What is the data type of the object array?
2: What type is the object array?
3: What is the data type of the elements in the object array?
please select question:
What is the data type of the object array?

Answer:
The data type of the object array is an array of objects.

Revised Query: A deep copy of an object array can be created by cloning each object in the array.

Recommend APIs:
1. java.lang.Object.clone()
2. java.util.Arrays.copyOf()
3. java.util.ArrayList.clone()
4. java.lang.System.arraycopy()
5. java.util.Arrays.deepCopy()
6. java.util.ArrayList.toArray()


Questions:
1: Does the deep copy need to clone all fields of each object in the array?
2: What is the expected output of the deep copy?
3: What type of objects are contained in the array?
please select question:
Does the deep copy need to clone all fields of each object in the array?

Answer:
Yes, in order to create a deep copy of an object array, all fields of each object must be cloned.

Revised Query: A deep copy of an object array requires cloning all fields of each object in the array.

Questions:
1: "What types of fields comprise the objects in the array?"
2: What type of cloning do you require to create a deep copy - shallow, deep or both?
3: What data type are the objects in the array?
please select question:
"What types of fields comprise the objects in the array?"

Answer:
The types of fields that comprise the objects in the array depend on the specific objects in the array.

Revised Query: A deep copy of an object array requires cloning all fields of each object in the array, regardless of the types of fields that comprise the objects.

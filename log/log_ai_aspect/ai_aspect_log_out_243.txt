Query: What is optimal way to get four unique random number from 0-9.


Questions:
1: Are we looking for a specific range of numbers, or is any set of four unique random numbers acceptable?
2: Is the order of the random numbers important?
3: Do you need the random numbers to be non-repetitive?

Questions:
1: Are you looking for a way to get the four numbers one at a time, or all four simultaneously?
2: Are any numbers allowed to be repeated or must they all be distinct?
3: Is there a preference for a particular approach, such as using a loop or using an existing API?

Answer:
One at a time.

Revised Query: The optimal way to get four unique random numbers from 0-9 is to generate them one at a time.

Questions:
1: Are the four random numbers to be obtained in a single execution of the query or can they be obtained in multiple executions?
2: Are you looking for the most efficient way to generate random numbers, or for any way that produces a random set of four unique numbers?
3: Do you need the random numbers generated all at once or one at a time?
please select question:
Are the four random numbers to be obtained in a single execution of the query or can they be obtained in multiple executions?

Answer:
The four random numbers can be obtained in multiple executions.

Revised Query: The optimal way to get four unique random numbers from 0-9 is to execute the query multiple times to obtain one random number each time.

Questions:
1: Which data type should the generated random numbers be?
2: Are the four random numbers required to be of integer data type?
3: Are you looking for a Java built-in data type (byte, float, char, boolean, double etc.) solution to get the four unique random numbers from 0-9?
please select question:
Which data type should the generated random numbers be?

Answer:
int

Revised Query: The optimal way to get four unique random numbers from 0-9 is to execute the query multiple times, each time generating an int type random number.

Questions:
1: Is the order of the four random numbers important or any set of four unique random numbers is acceptable?
2: Is there a requirement for the manner in which the four unique random numbers should be generated (e.g. using a specific algorithm or function)?
3: Is the order of the four random numbers important?
please select question:
Is the order of the four random numbers important or any set of four unique random numbers is acceptable?

Answer:
The order of the four random numbers is not important; any set of four unique random numbers is acceptable.

Revised Query: The optimal way to get four unique random numbers from 0-9 is to execute the query multiple times, each time generating an int type random number. The order of the four random numbers is not important.

Query: How to sort by two fields in Java.


Questions:
1: Does the sorting need to apply to a particular data structure (e.g. an array or a list), or does it need to apply across multiple data structures?
2: What type of data structure do you need to be sorted by two fields?
3: What order should the fields be sorted in?

Does the sorting need to apply to a particular data structure (e.g. an array or a list), or does it need to apply across multiple data structures?

Answer:
It depends on the specific requirements of the sorting task.

Revised Query: The query should be expanded to: "How can two fields be sorted in Java, depending on the specific requirements of the sorting task?"

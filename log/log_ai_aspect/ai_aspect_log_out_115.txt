Query: Making Thread sleep for random amount of MS.


Questions:
1: What is the range of milliseconds that the Thread needs to sleep for?
2: Is the random amount of time generated by program or by user input?
3: What is the range of milliseconds for random thread sleep?
please select question:
What is the range of milliseconds that the Thread needs to sleep for?

Answer:
The range of milliseconds that the Thread needs to sleep for depends on the condition specified in the query.

Revised Query: The Thread needs to sleep for a random amount of milliseconds within the specified range.

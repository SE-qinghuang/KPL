Query: Implement binary search in objects.


Questions:
1: Are you looking to implement binary search on an array of objects or on a data structure for objects?
2: Do you want to implement binary search in an array of objects, or do you want to implement binary search with objects as the search items?
3: What type of objects are you looking to use binary search on?

Are you looking to implement binary search on an array of objects or on a data structure for objects?

Answer:
Implement binary search on an array of objects.

Revised Query: The query is to implement binary search on an array of objects.

What data type are the objects in the array?

Answer:
The data type of the objects in the array will depend on the type of the array.

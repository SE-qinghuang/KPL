Questions:
1: Is the timer expected to be independent of system time both when the system is in operation and when it is powered off?
2: What type of stability does the timer need?
3: Does the timer need to be immune to external common-mode signals or temperature variation?

Answer:
No, the hardware timer does not need to support a range of java built-in data types.

Revised Query: The required timer is a hardware timer that is independent of system time both when the system is in operation and when it is powered off, and is completely independent of the system time even after a power failure or restart of the system, without needing to support a range of java built-in data types.

Questions:
1: Does the hardware timer need to support the ability to store and recall a range of Java built-in data types?
2: What is the exact range of time the hardware timer is expected to track?  Is it expected to maintain accuracy while accounting for system sleep and power cycles?
3: Does the hardware timer need to support a range of Java built-in data types?

Does the hardware timer need to support the ability to store and recall a range of Java built-in data types?

Answer:
No, the hardware timer does not need to support the ability to store and recall a range of Java built-in data types in order to be stable and independent of system time.

Revised Query: A stable timer independent of system time is a hardware timer that is expected to remain independent of system time both when the system is in operation and when it is powered off, even after a power failure or restart of the system, without needing to support a range of Java built-in data types or the ability to store and recall them.

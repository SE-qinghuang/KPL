Query: Grouping by List of Map in Java 8.


Questions:
1: Which interfaces will you be using to group the List of Maps with?
2: Are you trying to group items in the List of Map or from a single Map?
3: Are you looking to group elements within the Map or use the Map to group list elements?
please select question:
Which interfaces will you be using to group the List of Maps with?

Answer:
The Collector interface will be used to group the List of Maps.

Recommend APIs:
1. java.util.stream.Collectors.groupingBy(Classifier<? super T>, Collector<? super T,A,D>) 
2. java.util.stream.Collectors.toList() 
3. java.util.Map.entrySet() 
4. java.util.Map.put() 
5. java.util.List.add()

Revised Query: The Collector interface will be used to group the List of Maps in Java 8.


Questions:
1: Which class of Collector will be used to group the List of Maps (eg. GroupingBy, Joining etc.)?
2: What kind of output data structure would you like after the grouping is completed?
3: Which operations need to be performed on the List of Maps?

Which class of Collector will be used to group the List of Maps (eg. GroupingBy, Joining etc.)?

Answer:
GroupingBy

Revised Query: The Collector interface will be used to group the List of Maps, using the GroupingBy class.


Questions:
1: What is the expected return type for the grouping operation?
2: Which particular data type needs to be retrieved from the List of Maps after the Collector interface is applied?
3: "What kind of output do you expect from the Collector interface?"
please select question:
What is the expected return type for the grouping operation?

Answer:
Map<Object, List<Object>>

Recommend APIs:
1. java.util.stream.Collectors.groupingBy(Function<? super T,? extends K> classifier)
2. java.util.List.stream() -- (new)
3. java.util.stream.Collectors.toMap(Function<? super T,? extends K> keyMapper, Function<? super T,? extends U> valueMapper)
4. java.util.stream.Collectors.toList() -- (new)

Revised Query: The Collector interface's GroupingBy class will be used to group the List of Maps, with the expected return type being Map<Object, List<Object>>.


Questions:
1: Would you like to group the list of maps based on a common key within each map?
2: What type of Object do you want the grouping to be based on?
3: What type of key and values do you want to use for the grouping operation?
please select question:
Would you like to group the list of maps based on a common key within each map?

Answer:
Yes.

Recommend APIs:
1. java.util.Stream.collect(Collector) -- (new)
2. java.util.stream.Collectors.groupingBy(Function) -- (new)
3. java.util.stream.Collectors.toList()
4. java.util.HashMap.put(Object, List<Object>) -- (new)
5. java.util.Map.entrySet() -- (new)
6. java.util.List.stream()

Revised Query: The Collector interface's GroupingBy class will be used to group the List of Maps, with the expected return type being a Map<Object, List<Object>>, based on a common key within each map.


Questions:
1: Which key types need to be used for creating the GroupingByMap?
2: Are you attempting to group the List of Maps by a specific key or multiple keys?
3: What specific data type do you wish to collect on each of the list elements?
please select question:
Which key types need to be used for creating the GroupingByMap?

Answer:
The key type used for creating the GroupingByMap needs to be a Function.

Recommend APIs:
1. java.util.stream.Collectors.groupingBy(Function<? super T,? extends K> classifier)  -- (new)
2. java.util.stream.Collectors.toMap(Function<? super T,? extends K> keyMapper, Function<? super T,? extends U> valueMapper)  -- (new)
3. java.util.function.Function.apply(Object t)  -- (new)
4. java.util.List.forEach(Consumer<? super T> action) -- (new)
5. java.util.Map.put(Object key, Object value)  -- (new)
6. java.util.List.add(E e) -- (new)

Revised Query: The Collector interface will be used to group the List of Maps using the GroupingBy class, which will return a Map<Object, List<Object>> based on a common key within each map, using a Function as the key type.

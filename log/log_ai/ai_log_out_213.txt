The expanded query is: To convert a negative integer into two's complement binary form in Java, the size of the integer in bits must be determined, depending on the data type used to store the integer.


Questions:
1: What is the data type and size of the negative integer you are attempting to convert into two's complement binary form?
2: What data type is the negative integer being stored as (int or long) and what is its size in bits?
3: What data type is being used to store the negative integer in Java: int or long?
please select question:
What is the data type and size of the negative integer you are attempting to convert into two's complement binary form?

Answer:
The data type and size of the negative integer will depend on the programming language you are using. In Java, the data type of the negative integer will be an int, which is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer.

Query: What is optimal way to get four unique random number from 0-9.


Questions:
1: Are you trying to get integer numbers or real numbers?
2: Are you looking for a specific range of numbers from 0-9, or are you looking for random numbers from any range?
3: Do you want the numbers to be inclusive of 0 and 9?
please select question:
Are you trying to get integer numbers or real numbers?

Answer:
Integer numbers.

Recommend APIs:
1. java.util.Random.ints(int origin, int bound)
2. java.util.stream.IntStream.distinct()
3. java.util.stream.IntStream.limit(long maxSize)
4. java.util.stream.IntStream.collect(java.util.stream.Collector collector)

Revised Query: The query is asking for an optimal way to get four unique random integer numbers from 0-9.


Questions:
1: Is the range of numbers you are looking for 0 - 9 inclusive or exclusive?
2: Are you looking for a method to generate random integer numbers within a given range, or for a list of randomly selected integers within the range of 0-9?
3: Are we looking for the numbers to be stored in an array or list?
please select question:
Is the range of numbers you are looking for 0 - 9 inclusive or exclusive?

Answer:
Inclusive.

Revised Query: The optimal way to get four unique random integer numbers from 0 to 9 inclusive is to use a random number generator.


Questions:
1: Is this range of numbers 0-9 to be considered consecutive or in any order?
2: Are you looking for a single call to an API to generate all four numbers, or do you need to utilize multiple calls and store the results to ensure uniqueness?
3: Does the random number sequence need to be preserved for successive requests?

Revised Query: The optimal way to get four unique random integer numbers from 0 to 9 inclusive is to generate four random numbers from the range 0 to 9.


Questions:
1: Would you like the four unique random numbers to be generated in sequential or non-sequential order?
2: Would you like the numbers to be in sequential order?
3: Do you need the random number to be non-repeating?
please select question:
Would you like the four unique random numbers to be generated in sequential or non-sequential order?

Answer:
Non-sequential order.

3. java.util.List.add  -- (new)
4. java.util.Collections.shuffle  -- (new)
5. java.util.stream.IntStream.limit(long maxSize)

Revised Query: The optimal way to get four unique random numbers from 0-9 (inclusive) in any order and non-sequential order is to generate them randomly.


Questions:
1: Are you looking for a particular programming language, such as Java, to use in generating the four unique numbers?
2: Do you need the random numbers to be generated programmatically, or can you use a built-in library?
3: Are you looking for a deterministic solution that is repeatable, or a random solution that will offer different results each time?

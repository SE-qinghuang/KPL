Query: Access static final variable using reflection.


Questions:
1: Is the variable name known at compile-time, or is it determined at runtime?
2: What type of class are you working with? Is it a standard Java class or a user-defined class?
3: Is the static final variable a member of a class or an interface?
please select question:
Is the variable name known at compile-time, or is it determined at runtime?

Answer:
It is determined at runtime.

Recommend APIs:
1.java.lang.Class.getDeclaredField
2.java.lang.reflect.Field.get
3.java.lang.reflect.Field.getModifiers
4.java.lang.reflect.Modifier.isStatic
5.java.lang.reflect.Modifier.isFinal

Revised Query: The static final variable can be accessed using reflection at runtime.


Questions:
1: Are you looking to access the variable within an existing class or to create an instance of the variable's type?
2: Is this static final variable in the same class being accessed, or is it in a different class?
3: What type of data is the static final variable storing?
please select question:
Are you looking to access the variable within an existing class or to create an instance of the variable's type?

Answer:
Access the variable within an existing class.

Revised Query: Access a static final variable using reflection, where the variable name is determined at runtime and is within an existing class.


Questions:
1: Is the existing class public or private?
2: Are you attempting to access the value or invoke the referenced method of the static final variable?
3: Is the class a part of a third-party library, or have you created this class?
please select question:
Is the existing class public or private?

Answer:
It depends on the existing class.

Revised Query: Access static final variables using reflection in an existing class, where the variable name is determined at runtime.


Questions:
1: What is the name of the class from which you would like to access the static final variable?
2: What specific class is this variable accessing within?
3: What is the name of the existing class that you want to access the static final variable from using reflection?
please select question:
What is the name of the class from which you would like to access the static final variable?

Answer:
The name of the class from which you would like to access the static final variable is the class containing the static final variable.

Recommend APIs:
1. java.lang.Class.getField(String name)
2. java.lang.reflect.Field.get(Object obj)
3. java.lang.reflect.Field.getModifiers()

5. java.lang.reflect.Modifier.isPublic(int modifiers) -- (new)
6. java.lang.reflect.Modifier.isStatic(int modifiers) -- (new)

Revised Query: Access the static final variable within an existing class using reflection.


Questions:
1: What is the name of the class containing the static final variable you would like to access with reflection?
2: What is the name of the class containing the static final variable that you would like to access?
3: What is the name of the class containing the static final variable that you want to access?
please select question:
What is the name of the class containing the static final variable you would like to access with reflection?

Answer:
The name of the class containing the static final variable you would like to access with reflection is the class containing the variable.

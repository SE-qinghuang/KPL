Query: Implement binary search in objects.


Questions:
1: Is the object already sorted?
2: What type of objects are you looking to use for the binary search?
3: What type of objects are you hoping to use in your binary search?
please select question:
Is the object already sorted?

Answer:
Yes or No

Recommend APIs:
1. java.util.Arrays.binarySearch
2. java.util.Collections.binarySearch
3. java.util.TreeMap.containsKey
4. java.util.TreeMap.get
5. java.util.TreeMap.floorEntry
6. java.util.TreeMap.ceilingEntry

Revised Query: The object must be sorted in order to implement binary search.


Questions:
1: Do you require an indexed array for the binary search?
2: Would you like to implement a recursive or iterative binary search?
3: Do you need to store the objects in sorted order for the binary search implementation?
please select question:
Do you require an indexed array for the binary search?

Answer:
Yes, an indexed array is required for the binary search.

1. java.util.Arrays.binarySearch() -- (new)
2. java.util.Collections.binarySearch() -- (new)
3. java.util.Collections.sort() -- (new)
4. java.util.Arrays.sort() -- (new)

Revised Query: A binary search can be implemented in an object by sorting the object's indexed array and then using the binary search algorithm to search for the desired element.


Questions:
1: Is there an indexed array available to be used for the binary search?
2: Is an indexed array of objects available for the binary search?
3: Does the array contain pre-sorted data or does the binary search have to be used to sort the array?
please select question:
Is there an indexed array available to be used for the binary search?

Answer:
Yes, an indexed array can be used for the binary search.

Recommend APIs:
1. java.util.Arrays.binarySearch()
2. java.lang.Comparable.compareTo() -- (new)
3. java.lang.Integer.compare() -- (new)
4. java.util.List.indexOf() -- (new)
5. java.util.List.get() -- (new)
6. java.util.List.toArray() -- (new)

Revised Query: The object must be sorted and an indexed array is required to implement a binary search, and an indexed array is available to be used.


Questions:
1: Do you need the binary search to be implemented in a specific object type?
2: Has the array been indexed already, or do you need help with that?
3: Which type of objects do you want to use for the array?
please select question:
Do you need the binary search to be implemented in a specific object type?

Answer:
Yes, please specify the object type.

Recommend APIs:
1.java.util.Arrays.binarySearch(Object[] a, Object key) -- (new)
2.java.util.Arrays.sort(Object[] a) -- (new)
3.java.util.Collections.binarySearch(List list, Object key) -- (new)
4.java.util.Collections.sort(List list) -- (new)
5.java.util.List.indexOf(Object o) -- (new)
6.java.util.List.get(int index) -- (new)

Revised Query: The binary search needs to be implemented in a specific object type, and an indexed array is required for the binary search, assuming the object is already sorted.


Questions:
1: What type of object are you wanting to run a binary search on?
2: What is the type of the object that the Binary Search needs to be implemented on?
3: What type of objects are you looking to binary search?
please select question:
What type of object are you wanting to run a binary search on?

Answer:
Any type of object.

Recommend APIs:
1. java.util.Arrays.binarySearch()  -- (new)
2. java.util.Collections.binarySearch()
3. java.util.List.indexOf()
4. java.util.List.search() -- (new)
5. java.util.ArrayList.binarySearch()  -- (new)
6. java.util.TreeMap.binarySearch() -- (new)

Revised Query: The binary search can be implemented on any type of object, provided that an indexed array is available and the object is already sorted.

Query: Stable timer independent of system time.


Questions:
1: Do you require a high degree of accuracy (e.g. within milliseconds or microseconds) or are you looking for something more general (e.g. within minutes or hours)?
2: Is the timer needed for real-time applications or just general use?
3: Are you looking for a timer that runs independently of the system time?

Revised Query: I am looking for a stable timer that is independent of system time and has a high degree of accuracy within milliseconds or microseconds.


Questions:
1: Do you need your timer to have a high degree of accuracy (e.g. within milliseconds or microseconds)?
2: Do you need the timer to remain unaffected by external events and system time changes?
3: Do you require the timer to be accurately independent of changes to the system time or does a certain degree of fluctuation in accuracy suffice?

Revised Query: I need a stable timer with a high degree of accuracy (e.g. within milliseconds or microseconds) that is independent of system time.


Questions:
1: Do you want the timer to be precise to the nanosecond, or is millisecond precision sufficient?
2: Do you require millisecond or microsecond accuracy?
3: What accuracy level do you need (in milliseconds or microseconds)?

5. java.time.Clock -- (new)

Revised Query: The query is for a stable timer that is independent of system time and has a high degree of accuracy within milliseconds or microseconds, but not necessarily to the nanosecond.


Questions:
1: Do you need the timer to be accurate to a fraction of a second (i.e. second level accuracy)?
2: What accuracy level would you like to achieve (e.g. millisecond, microsecond or nanosecond)?
3: What degree of accuracy do you need for the stable timer?

Query: How to convert Integer to int.


Questions:
1: Does the Integer need to be obtained from an external source or is it generated as part of your program?
2: Do you need to know how to do this conversion between two specific Integers or would you like a general solution that works for any integer?
3: Is the Integer object you are trying to convert coming from a user input or a data set?

Does the Integer need to be obtained from an external source or is it generated as part of your program?

Answer:
It depends on the context. If the Integer is obtained from an external source, then it may need to be converted to an int type. If the Integer is generated as part of your program, then it may not need to be converted.

Recommend APIs:
1. Integer.intValue()
2. Integer.parseInt(String s)
3. Integer.valueOf(int i)
4. Integer.valueOf(String s)

Revised Query: The Integer may need to be converted to an int type, depending on whether it is obtained from an external source or generated as part of the program.


Questions:
1: Where does the Integer come from? Is it from an external source or generated from within the program?
2: Is the Integer obtained from an external source or is it generated as part of your program?
3: Is the Integer obtained from an external source or generated in your program?

Where does the Integer come from? Is it from an external source or generated from within the program?

Answer:
It depends. If the Integer is coming from an external source, it may need to be parsed or converted to an int. If the Integer is generated within the program, it may already be in the correct format and no conversion is necessary.

Recommend APIs:
1. java.lang.Integer.intValue() -- (new)
2. java.lang.Number.intValue() -- (new)

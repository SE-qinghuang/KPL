Query: What is the fastest way to copy a double[] in Java.


Questions:
1: Are you looking for an immutable or a mutable copy solution?
2: Is the double[] a primitive or an object array?
3: Are you looking for a way to deep-copy the double[] or a shallow-copy?

Are you looking for an immutable or a mutable copy solution?

Answer:
It depends on the desired outcome. If you are looking for an immutable copy, then the Arrays.copyOf() method is the fastest way to copy a double[]. If you are looking for a mutable copy, then the System.arraycopy() method is the fastest way to copy a double[].

Recommend APIs:
1. java.util.Arrays.copyOf(double[], int)
2. java.util.Arrays.clone()
3. java.util.Arrays.copyOfRange(double[], int, int)
4. java.util.Arrays.asList()
5. java.util.stream.IntStream.of()
6. java.util.stream.IntStream.toArray()

Revised Query: The fastest way to copy a double[] in Java is either Arrays.copyOf() for an immutable copy, or System.arraycopy() for a mutable copy.


Questions:
1: Are you looking for an immutable or mutable copy of the double-array?
2: Are you looking for an immutable or mutable copy of a double[]?

Are you looking for an immutable or mutable copy of the double-array?

Answer:
It depends on the desired outcome. If you are looking for an immutable copy, then the Arrays.copyOf() method is the fastest way to copy a double[]. If you are looking for a mutable copy, then the System.arraycopy() method is the fastest way to copy a double[].

Recommend APIs:
1. java.util.Arrays.copyOf() -- (new)
2. java.lang.System.arraycopy() -- (new)

Revised Query: The fastest way to copy a double[] in Java is either the Arrays.copyOf() method for an immutable copy, or the System.arraycopy() method for a mutable copy.

3. java.util.Arrays.copyOfRange() -- (new)
4. java.lang.Object.clone() -- (new)
5. java.util.Arrays.copyOfRange(Object[] original, int from, int to) -- (new)

Revised Query: The fastest way to copy a double[] in Java is either the Arrays.copyOf() method for an immutable copy, or the System.arraycopy() method for a mutable copy.


Questions:
1: Are you looking for a mutable or immutable copy?
2: Are you looking for an immutable or mutable copy of the double[]?
3: Are you looking for an immutable copy or a mutable copy?
please select question:
Are you looking for a mutable or immutable copy?

Answer:
It depends on the desired outcome. If you are looking for a mutable copy, you can use System.arraycopy(). If you are looking for an immutable copy, you can use Arrays.copyOf().

Recommend APIs:
1. java.lang.System.arraycopy()
2. java.util.Arrays.copyOf()

Revised Query: The fastest way to copy a double[] in Java is to use either the Arrays.copyOf() method for an immutable copy, or the System.arraycopy() method for a mutable copy, depending on the desired outcome.


Questions:
1: Are you looking for an immutable or mutable copy of the double[]?
2: Would you like to create an immutable or mutable copy of the double[]?
3: Are you looking for a mutable or an immutable copy of the double[]?

Are you looking for an immutable or mutable copy of the double[]?

Answer:
It depends on the desired outcome. If you are looking for an immutable copy, then the Arrays.copyOf() method is the fastest way to copy a double[]. If you are looking for a mutable copy, then the System.arraycopy() method is the fastest way to copy a double[].

Recommend APIs:
1. java.lang.System.arraycopy(Object, int, Object, int, int) -- (new)
2. java.util.Arrays.copyOf(double[], int)
3. java.util.Arrays.copyOfRange(double[], int, int)
4. java.util.Arrays.deepCopyOf(double[]) -- (new)

Revised Query: The fastest way to copy a double[] in Java is either Arrays.copyOf() for an immutable copy, or System.arraycopy() for a mutable copy.

Query: Making Thread sleep for random amount of MS.


Questions:
1: Is the thread sleeping for a fixed or variable amount of milliseconds?
2: What is the minimum number of milliseconds you want to specify for the thread to sleep?
3: Are you looking for a way to make a start a thread and sleep for an specified amount of milliseconds or a random amount of milliseconds?
please select question:
Is the thread sleeping for a fixed or variable amount of milliseconds?

Answer:
Variable amount of milliseconds.

Recommend APIs:
1. java.lang.Thread.sleep(long millis)
2. java.lang.Thread.getName()
3. java.lang.Thread.interrupt()
4. java.lang.Thread.join(long millis)
5. java.lang.Thread.setName(String name)
6. java.lang.Thread.isAlive()
7. java.lang.Thread.getState()

Revised Query: The thread is sleeping for a random amount of milliseconds.


Questions:
1: What is the range of milliseconds you would like the Thread to sleep for?
2: How long should the Thread sleep for (in milliseconds)?
3: How long would you like the thread to sleep for the random amount of milliseconds?
please select question:
What is the range of milliseconds you would like the Thread to sleep for?

Answer:
The range of milliseconds for the Thread to sleep for will depend on the specific requirements of the application.

Recommend APIs:
1. java.lang.Thread.sleep(long millis);  -- (new)
2. java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis();  -- (new)
3. java.lang.Object.wait(long millis); -- (new)
4. java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; -- (new)
5. java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom.current(); -- (new)
6. java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor; -- (new)
7. java.util.Timer.schedule(TimerTask task, long delay); -- (new)

Revised Query: The Thread will be made to sleep for a variable amount of milliseconds, depending on the specific requirements of the application.


Questions:
1: What is the precise range of milliseconds for the Thread to sleep for?
2: What range of milliseconds do you need the Thread to sleep for?
3: What is the maximum and minimum range of milliseconds you would like the Thread to sleep for?
please select question:
What is the precise range of milliseconds for the Thread to sleep for?

Answer:
The precise range of milliseconds for the Thread to sleep for will depend on the random number generated.

Recommend APIs:
1.java.lang.Thread.sleep(long millis)  -- (new)
2.java.util.Random.nextInt(int bound)  -- (new)
3.java.util.Random.nextLong()  -- (new)
4.java.util.Random.nextDouble()  -- (new)

9.java.lang.Thread.setDaemon(boolean on)  -- (new)
10.java.lang.Thread.setName(String name) -- (new)

Revised Query: The Thread will sleep for a variable amount of milliseconds, depending on the random number generated within the specified range.


Questions:
1: What range of milliseconds is required for the Thread to sleep for?
2: What specific range (i.e. from X to Y milliseconds) of random milliseconds units should the Thread sleep for?
3: What is the minimum and maximum range of milliseconds that the Thread needs to sleep for?
please select question:
What range of milliseconds is required for the Thread to sleep for?

Answer:
The range of milliseconds required for the Thread to sleep for will depend on the specific requirements of the application.

Recommend APIs:
1.java.util.Random.nextLong() -- (new)
2.java.lang.Thread.sleep(long millis) -- (new)
3.java.lang.Thread.interrupt() -- (new)
4.java.lang.Thread.join() -- (new)
5.java.lang.Thread.setName(String name) -- (new)
6.java.lang.Thread.getName() -- (new)

Revised Query: The Thread will sleep for a variable amount of milliseconds, depending on the random number generated and the specific requirements of the application.


Questions:
1: What range of values is needed for the random number generated in order to decide the amount of milliseconds for the Thread to sleep for?
2: What is the specific range of milliseconds that you require for the Thread to sleep for?
3: What is the required range of milliseconds for the Thread to sleep for?
please select question:
What range of values is needed for the random number generated in order to decide the amount of milliseconds for the Thread to sleep for?

Answer:
The range of values needed for the random number generated in order to decide the amount of milliseconds for the Thread to sleep for is 0 to the maximum value of the data type used to store the number.

Recommend APIs:
1. java.util.Random.nextLong() -- (new)
2. java.lang.Thread.sleep(long millis)
3. java.lang.Integer.MAX_VALUE() -- (new)

Revised Query: The Thread will sleep for a random amount of milliseconds, with the range of values for the random number generated being 0 to the maximum value of the data type used to store the number.

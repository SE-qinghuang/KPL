Query: Deep copy of an object array.


Questions:
1: Does the deep copy apply specifically to the data structure of the object array, or do you also need to replicate the values stored in the array?
2: Does the deep copy refer to cloning or copying by value?
3: Do you need a deep copy of the array values or the references of the objects in the array?

Does the deep copy apply specifically to the data structure of the object array, or do you also need to replicate the values stored in the array?

Answer:
You also need to replicate the values stored in the array.

Revised Query: A deep copy of an object array requires replicating both the data structure and the values stored in the array.


Questions:
1: Do you need to create a deep copy of the array that modifies the original references of objects within the array?
2: Are the values in the object array primitives or references to other objects?
3: Do you need the deep copy to keep the same references to the objects in the array?

Do you need to create a deep copy of the array that modifies the original references of objects within the array?

Revised Query: A deep copy of an object array requires replicating the values stored in the array and creating a copy of the array that modifies the original references of objects within the array.


Questions:
1: What type of object is the array composed of?
2: Do you need to replicate the object references as well, or just the values stored in the array?
3: What type of objects are contained in the array?

Revised Query: A deep copy of an object array requires replicating the values stored in the array and creating a copy that modifies the original references of objects within the array.


Questions:
1: What type of object are you attempting to deep copy?
2: Do you need to deep copy the array of objects, or just the values stored in the array?
3: Do you need to make an exact copy (i.e. shallow or deep copy) of the objects in the array?
please select question:
What type of object are you attempting to deep copy?

Answer:
Array of objects.

Revised Query: The query is: Deep copy of an object array, which requires replicating the values stored in the array and creating a deep copy of the array that modifies the original references of objects within the array.


Questions:
1: Are any of the objects in the array primitive data types, such as integers or doubles?
2: What type of objects are stored in the array?
3: Are you looking to copy the references to the objects stored in the array or are you looking to create a new instance of each object and store it in the array?
please select question:
Are any of the objects in the array primitive data types, such as integers or doubles?

Answer:
No.

Revised Query: The deep copy of an object array requires replicating the values stored in the array and creating a deep copy of the array that modifies the original references of objects within the array, which are all objects and not primitive data types.
